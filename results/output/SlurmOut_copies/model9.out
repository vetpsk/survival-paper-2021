  data.table is using 2 threads. See ?setDTthreads.
Input contains no \n. Taking this to be a filename to open
[01] Check arguments
  Using 2 threads (omp_get_max_threads()=4, nth=2)
  NAstrings = [<<NA>>]
  None of the NAstrings look like numbers.
  show progress = 0
  0/1 column will be read as integer
[02] Opening the file
  Opening file survivaldata.csv
  File opened, size = 22.08GB (23711914322 bytes).
  Memory mapped ok
[03] Detect and skip BOM
[04] Arrange mmap to be \0 terminated
  \n has been found in the input and different lines can end with different line endings (e.g. mixed \n and \r\n in one file). This is common and ideal.
[05] Skipping initial rows if needed
  Positioned on line 1 starting: <<AnimalIdentifier,BirthDate,Her>>
[06] Detect separator, quoting rule, and ncolumns
  Detecting sep automatically ...
  sep=','  with 100 lines of 18 fields using quote rule 0
  Detected 18 columns on line 1. This line is either column names or first data row. Line starts as: <<AnimalIdentifier,BirthDate,Her>>
  Quote rule picked = 0
  fill=false and the most number of columns found is 18
[07] Detect column types, good nrow estimate and whether first row is column names
  'header' changed by user from 'auto' to true
  Number of sampling jump points = 100 because (23711914321 bytes from row 1 to eof) / (2 * 19885 jump0size) == 596226
  Type codes (jump 000)    : AA5AA5AAAAAA775AAA  Quote rule 0
  Type codes (jump 100)    : AA5AA5AAAAAA775AAA  Quote rule 0

  =====
[08] Assign column names
[09] Apply user overrides on column types
  After 0 type and 0 drop user overrides : AA5AA5AAAAAA775AAA
[10] Allocate memory for the datatable
  Allocating 18 column slots (18 - 0 dropped) with 131813307 rows
[11] Read the data
  jumps=[0..22614), chunk_size=1048550, total_size=23711914141
Read 114498459 rows x 18 columns from 22.08GB (23711914322 bytes) file in 24:38.750 wall clock time
