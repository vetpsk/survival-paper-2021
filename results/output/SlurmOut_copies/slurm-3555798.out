Input contains no \n. Taking this to be a filename to open
[01] Check arguments
  Using 2 threads (omp_get_max_threads()=4, nth=2)
  NAstrings = [<<NA>>]
  None of the NAstrings look like numbers.
  show progress = 0
  0/1 column will be read as integer
[02] Opening the file
  Opening file survivaldata.csv
  File opened, size = 20.96GB (22504043585 bytes).
  Memory mapped ok
[03] Detect and skip BOM
[04] Arrange mmap to be \0 terminated
  \n has been found in the input and different lines can end with different line endings (e.g. mixed \n and \r\n in one file). This is common and ideal.
[05] Skipping initial rows if needed
  Positioned on line 1 starting: <<AnimalIdentifier,BirthDate,Her>>
[06] Detect separator, quoting rule, and ncolumns
  Detecting sep automatically ...
  sep=','  with 100 lines of 17 fields using quote rule 0
  Detected 17 columns on line 1. This line is either column names or first data row. Line starts as: <<AnimalIdentifier,BirthDate,Her>>
  Quote rule picked = 0
  fill=false and the most number of columns found is 17
[07] Detect column types, good nrow estimate and whether first row is column names
  'header' changed by user from 'auto' to true
  Number of sampling jump points = 100 because (22504043584 bytes from row 1 to eof) / (2 * 18884 jump0size) == 595849

[08] Assign column names
[09] Apply user overrides on column types
  After 0 type and 0 drop user overrides : AA5AA5AAAAA775AAA
[10] Allocate memory for the datatable
  Allocating 17 column slots (17 - 0 dropped) with 132903547 rows
[11] Read the data
  jumps=[0..21462), chunk_size=1048552, total_size=22504043415
