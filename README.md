# Survival analysis of dairy cows in the Netherlands under altering agricultural policy

Version 0.1

Changes in agricultural policy such as milk-quota abolishment impact herd size and might influence culling decisions of dairy farmers. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling strategy for studying the relevant cow-level risk factors for survival of Dutch dairy cows representing production, reproduction and metabolic health performances under perturbations due to agricultural policy changes.
